Computer Science Terms 

    There are 2 states (binary) - ON and OFF 
    * **machine code** - language readable by computers. They are instructions for the processor.  
    * **CPU** - consists of a bunch of switches(transistors). It interprets and executes instructions from memory    
    * **binary** - counting method for computers, but for 0 to turn off and 1 to turn on. A combination of numbers mean a different command
    * **executable** - refers to machine language. It's code that generates after a compiler 
    * **source code** - human readable code written by a programmer 
    * **translator** - AKA programming language processor, program that translates source code into a target language 
    * **compiler** - a program that translates source code into machine code
    * **compile vs interpret program language** 
        * interpretted - runs and executes source code as it translates. Translates it line by line and runs immediately. 
        * compiled - translates source code all at once and returns a file (*executable* file) without executing source code. The executable file can be run again and again, the compiler doesn't need to be around!

    * **operating system** - bridge between hardware and software. It tells your computer how to be a useful computer and not just a box of wires.
    * **unix** - operating system created many decades ago by AT&T. It was mainly on big computers, so sold as commercial software 
        * **linux** - unix that works on smaller(home) machines 
    * **command line** - sends commands to your computer without GUI
    * **PATH** -  The location of where a computer, file, device, or web page is located
